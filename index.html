            <h3>Gameplay Mechanics</h3>
            
            <p>The core gameplay of Deadshot.io revolves around positioning, patience, and precision. Players spawn in various locations across the map and must quickly find advantageous positions while scanning for enemy targets. The sniper rifle mechanics are realistic, requiring players to account for distance and adjust their aim accordingly.</p>
            
            <p>Movement is crucial in Deadshot.io. Standing still makes you an easy target, but moving too much can compromise your accuracy. Successful players learn to balance mobility with stability, knowing when to relocate and when to hold position for the perfect shot.</p>
            
            <h3>Strategy Tips</h3>
            
            <div class="tips-box">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Find High Ground:</strong> Elevated positions provide better sightlines and make you harder to spot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use Cover Wisely:</strong> Always position yourself near cover that you can quickly duck behind after taking a shot.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lead Your Targets:</strong> Moving enemies require you to aim ahead of them to compensate for travel time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stay Unpredictable:</strong> Don't camp in the same spot for too long, as experienced players will remember your position.</li>
                    <li><strong>Practice Patience:</strong> Sometimes waiting for the perfect shot is better than taking multiple risky ones.</li>
                    <li><strong>Watch the Kill Feed:</strong> Pay attention to eliminations to track dangerous players and their locations.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Progression System</h3>
            
            <p>As you play Deadshot.io, you'll earn experience points for eliminations, assists, and victories. Leveling up unlocks new customization options, weapon skins, and potentially enhanced equipment. The progression system encourages continued play and rewards dedicated sharpshooters with exclusive content.</p>
            
            <h3>Why Deadshot.io Stands Out</h3>
            
            <p>What sets Deadshot.io apart from other browser-based shooters is its focus on skill-based gameplay. Unlike games with complex loadouts or pay-to-win mechanics, Deadshot.io emphasizes pure shooting ability. Every player has access to the same tools, making victories feel earned and defeats motivating for improvement.</p>
            
            <p>The game's accessibility is another major strength. Running directly in your browser without downloads or installations, Deadshot.io can be played anywhere, anytime. The simple controls make it easy to learn, but the skill ceiling is high enough to keep veteran players engaged for hours.</p>
            
            <h3>Community and Competitive Scene</h3>
            
            <p>Deadshot.io has cultivated an active community of competitive players who share strategies, organize tournaments, and create content around the game. The competitive scene continues to grow, with skilled players streaming their gameplay and sharing tips with newcomers.</p>
